## TODO
   - [ ] Add the Falcon logging to only from snippy logger. It also seems that Falcon blocks the logs during tests? All logs from Snippy logger - somehow?
   - [ ] Add more tests /api/v1/snippets.
   - [ ] Add limit to multilevel sort fields to two fields to avoid complex scenarios.
   - [ ] Add limits to all parameters: column array size, sort array size, etc. 
   - [ ] Fix GET /api/v1/snippets/{digest} with digest that is not found. This is currently set to return OK with empty list but should perhaps should result 404?
   - [ ] Fix "Make sure clients can use POST with the X-HTTP-Method-Override header to fake a PUT request, because some proxies only know GET and POST and will reject PUT requests."
   - [ ] Fix one failing API test fails all the WF cases? The cleanup does not work?
   - [ ] Add link to specific version API document for the /hello. Like https://readthedocs.com/snippy/0.7.0/api/documents.
   - [ ] Add link to specific OAS specficiation from failure test on top of homepage.
   - [ ] Add support for /api/v1/solutions.
   - [ ] Change tests to use Snippet.test_content2(compare_content) instaed of Snippet.test_content().
   - [ ] Add new module to split the config a bit. For example also get_keywords does not belong to Editor().
   - [ ] Fix test coverage that does not show coverage from -v|--version in the console test?
   - [ ] Add customer Falcon error code? now the 500 is string HTML and it is different than normal server error code.
   - [ ] It is not possible in OAS 2 to deffine single mandatory parameter from group? For example search must have at least one for GET. For OAS 3 this works?
   - [ ] Fix "If you want partial updates, use PATCH instead."
   - [ ] Why API performance test is so slow? Changed to http.client with 20% perf gain but still slow. Profile code next.
   - [ ] Add statistics framework to measure latencies and used time for APIs.
   - [ ] Update documents.
   - [ ] Fix api performance test failure which leaves the server running and hanging.
   - [ ] Test URL encoded REST API queries. The same problem that was with %2C may be with other formats.
   - [ ] Add support to run with runalias.
   - [ ] Add support to add versions to version list.
   - [ ] Fix next devel version to use 0.8.dev to separte possible git installs from released content.
   - [ ] Add support to print only selected fields, like brief and digest for text output. Hard to generalize since layout e.g. contains header with three fields.
   - [ ] Hide internal class level variables with _ or __ prefix. The intention is not to allow access to these.
   - [ ] How to use double hyphen with Snippy search queries? Like in: search --sall '--all'
   - [ ] Add to document that using double dash is interpreted as option. To use this in grep: search --sall "--all" --no-ansi | grep -- '--all'
   - [ ] Test manually the exception cases for example with file with Python3 and 2.7. Some exceptions may not be in Python2.7.
   - [ ] Document that solution text header date is not updated when the solution is updated. The metadata is updated.
   - [ ] Document that importing content defined with digest will be update operation internally. This allows importing the same content data again with OK cause.

## BUBBLING UNDER
   - [ ] See setup example from https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] Add setup.py longdescription from readme.rst. // https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] Check security implications from using setup.py (runs code) // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44878600/is-setup-cfg-deprecated
   - [ ] Add very strict validation for REST API? Even a light failure in params generate error?
   - [ ] Now --editor always means yes. The code forces yes to some cases like update solution. This parameter could be changed to no/yes to override internals.
   - [ ] It was noted that sys._getframe migth not exist in all Python implementations. Rerring to CPython. There is small performance advance using this. Fix?
   - [ ] Inherit the tests from object and remove unittest and change to teardown_class from pylint. This explains the case domino failures?
   - [ ] Is there a way to get logs from Python logger from stdout? Mocking stdout to StringIO does not even though the logger stream is stdout.
   - [ ] Fix patching in specific module. E.g snippy.migrate.migrate.os.path.isfile does not patch only specified module. Find 'side_effect' in import snippet.
   - [ ] Fix the example string from travis.yml to debug cores. Tee problem is not visible anymore so this requires more investigation.
   - [ ] Add support for REST API YAML responses.
   - [ ] How to add upgrade procedure? Is this needed? What happens when there is content stored and pip upgrade is made?
   - [ ] How to sign git commits. /1/ https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/) and code n PyPI (?)
   - [ ] How to sign PyPI code? Is this feasible?
   - [ ] Add statistics print that shows the amout of snippets and unique categories.
   - [ ] Fix case described in 'git log 11448a2e90dab3a' and somehow and make test_wf a bit nicer?
   - [ ] How to use BytePackager/packagecore?
   - [ ] Fix the Python2 test database naming to be random temp file in the same folder to allow parallelism.
   - [ ] Why when in Python2 a database test fails, it leaves hanging resources and DB clean does not work? Was this fixed into sqlite3_helper already?
   - [ ] How to better prevent commits to snippy.db than git hooks or git --assume-unchanged?

## DONE
   - [x] Fixed REST API parameters separated with %2C like in 'fields=brief%2Ccategory'.
   - [x] Fixed setup.cnf referring to non existent file. Added universal for bdist_wheel.
   - [x] Fixed empty tag and link list containing empty string in REST API response JSON.
   - [x] Added repr into ConfigSourceBase to be used like: print(repr(self.config.source)).

   - [x] Fixed REST API content data to work in string context lines separted by newlines and in list context.
   - [x] Tested using same URL parameter multiple times. Common behaviour is coming from Falcon framework.
   - [x] Fixed list of links to allow only space and bar "|" characters to separate links.

   - [x] Added experimental REST API with two tests to try it out.
   - [x] Fixed console tests and the test_console_very_verbose_option.
   - [x] Fixed Snippy() to use 'snippy' instead of root logger. This also fixed the -vv usage in Pylint.

   - [x] Fixed incorrect OK result when no content was imported at all.
   - [x] Fixed import failure message when same solution data was imported twice.
   - [x] Added support for importing multiple contents from text format.
   - [x] Fixed PyPI long description that was wrapping lines incorrect.

   - [x] Fixed the last missing empty line(s) from solution import.
   - [x] Added support to specify migrated content with message digest (update specific content).
   - [x] Fixed importing a template so that user does not have to define category in command line.

   - [x] Fixed import content data that already exist. If the data is already in there, it is still OK case.
   - [x] Added same search implementation into solution than snippet.

   - [x] Changed absolute path of database.sql to relative. This removed the need for mock and relative is better.
   - [x] Fixed hanging database resources that failed sequential test in case of database test failure. 
   - [x] Added timestamp in UTC time for created snippets.
   - [x] Added search with content with -c|--content option.
   - [x] Added basic snippet test suite in common library to avoid writing them to multiple test cases.

   - [x] Fixed inserting same snippet again so that the error is handled nicely.
   - [x] Changed the editor flag internally so that used do not need it when update is made with digest.
   - [x] Changed the CLI commands to behave and look like standard Linux CLI design.
   - [x] Changed small methods that have simple tests in Config() to use ternary operator.
   - [x] Changed print layout and the group to remove space after @ '.. force @docker [2dcbecd10330ac4d]'
   - [x] Changed the resolution to solution since the later is better.
   - [x] Changed the category internally to group to match new command line.
