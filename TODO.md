## TODO
   - [ ] Add search key that results all the database content.
   - [ ] Add docker container for the project.
   - [ ] Add tests for console and file outputs to verify list handling in tags and links.
   - [ ] Update documents.
   - [ ] Add support for cutting log string with lower logging levels. Long lines are nasty and meant for debugging.
   - [ ] Avoid string formatting when passing the log string to logger. Pass just the parameters for performance.
   - [ ] Add digest check when importing.
   - [ ] Fix search queries for tags and groups. Searching works only from all fields.
   - [ ] Add statistics print that shows the amout of snippets and unique categories.

## DONE
   - [x] Fixed the problem that the digest changed even though no changes were made in editor for the content.
   - [x] Fixed editor update that changed the list of tags to one string in a list.
   - [x] Fixed exit code suppression with the -q option.
   - [x] Added default group 'default' for the content.
   - [x] Added exit status that is by default the only string printed. Options -vv or --debug enable loggin.
   - [x] Fixed inserting same snippet again so that the error is handled nicely.
   - [x] Changed the editor flag internally so that used do not need it when update is made with digest.
   - [x] Changed the CLI commands to behave and look like standard Linux CLI design.
   - [x] Changed small methods that have simple tests in Config() to use ternary operator.
   - [x] Changed print layout and the group to remove space after @ '.. force @docker [2dcbecd10330ac4d]'
   - [x] Changed the resolution to solution since the later is better.
   - [x] Changed the category internally to group to match new command line.
   - [x] Added possibility to update existing snippet.
   - [x] Changed delete to work with the snippet digest instead of database rown number.
   - [x] Added hashes to identify snippets.
   - [x] Changed database tests to use dictionary format.
   - [x] Changed command line arguments to be more suitable for resolve cases as well.
   - [x] Added import functionality from json and yaml files.
   - [x] Added support for categories that allow grouping snippets into larger groups.
   - [x] Added command line option --debug to elevate the debug level and set the default level to error.
   - [x] Added text format export on top of yaml and json.
   - [x] Added multiline command snippets.
   - [x] Added input from editor.
   - [x] Changed tags to behave like links in exported yaml and json files. Keep console output of tags as string.
   - [x] Fixed argument testing and printing for tags and find arguments
