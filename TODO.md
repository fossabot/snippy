## WORKING
   - [ ] Add tests to update logging config. This goes to new Logger UT tests?
   - [ ] Add unit test for logger: 1) TZ with json-logs and others, 2) JSON-logs and other with --debug 3) JSON-logs and others with -vv, 4) OID change.

## FEATURES
   - [ ] Add X-HTTP-Method-Override support for PUT, PATCH or DELETE. GET must not change data // http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api
   - [ ] Remove DELETE collection and allow it only for specific resource.
   - [ ] Add total number of resources in meta like in http://jsonapi.org/examples/.
   - [ ] Add paginations and offsets to JSON API. Add 'offset' and it could work so that result is list where user points. Needs the total.
   - [ ] Add embedded security features.
   - [ ] Add /snippy/admin/v1/ API endpoint to manage server log configuration.
   - [ ] Add support for PATCH: "If you want partial updates, use PATCH instead."
   - [ ] Add support to get /snippet/123123324/brief and all the fields.
   - [ ] Add support to export content to markdown format.
   - [ ] Add limit to multilevel sort fields to two fields to avoid complex scenarios.
   - [ ] Add limits to all parameters: column array size, sort array size, etc.
   - [ ] Add support to run with runalias.
   - [ ] Add support to add versions to version list.
   - [ ] Add support to print only selected fields, like brief and digest for CLI text output. Hard to generalize since layout e.g. contains header with three fields.
   - [ ] Add statistics object which tracks peak and percentile latencies with memory and CPU usage.
   - [ ] Add support for REST API YAML responses.
   - [ ] Add upload command like in setup example from https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] How to add custom Falcon error codes? Now e.g. 500 is HTML string and it is different than normal Snippy server error code.
   - [ ] How to add custom Falcon exception handling through snippy logger?
   - [ ] Add server startup indicator like 'server running in 127.0.0.1:8080' or 'OK' (suppress with -q). This can be used in api performance test to see when the server is up.

## FIX
   - [ ] Fix test reference to match to main(['snippy', 'search', '--sall', '.', '--profile'])  ## workflow
   - [ ] Fix help tests since it is not reading new _cli_ tests. What I was thinking?
   - [ ] Fix wheel seems so create PyPI package that cannot access the defaults? Is this the case? This was working with sdist.
   - [ ] Fix when server parameters are erronous, error text from argparse is misleading since it complains about the content operations. Custom errors for --server?
   - [ ] Fix export the original which contains additional whitespace before the exported template in the DATE field. Was this some test?
   - [ ] Fix JSON API UTC time field does not follow ISO8601 format. This affects to utc mock and digest. It is better to refactor tests to make this easier.
   - [ ] Fix the get_template to Content(). Did this mean test helpers that uses the get_template? There is one case 
   - [ ] Fix indention in snippy: error: argument   {create,search,update,delete,export,import}. This indention is actually "must" in --help
   - [ ] Fix the REST API self link is not always present. It is set only in case of resources and if the digest field is not dropped from response.
   - [ ] Fix if the sys._getframe migth not exist in all Python implementations. Rerring to CPython. There is small performance advance using this. Fix?
   - [ ] Fix the example string from travis.yml to debug cores. Tee problem is not visible anymore so this requires more investigation.
   - [ ] Why falcon.API fails but the falcon import seems not to produce ImportError when the falcon is not imported?
   - [ ] Why enabling debug logs in pytest fixture for server does not show the logs from mocked REST API call? It only shows fixture imports.
   - [ ] Why 'I/O operation on closed file' is generated as in SCRIBLING.md
   - [ ] Why Logger() UT tests produce out to capsys when the logger Pytest fixture is not used? The logger fixture hides something?
   - [ ] How to use double hyphen with Snippy search queries? Like in: search --sall '--all'
   - [ ] Why changing self._data = data in data setter in line 160 to self.data = data in config base seems to cause core. This can be used to set the Travis gdb parameters.
   - [ ] Should _add_date in Content() be based on updated when DATE already set? The reason would be that this sets the text template DATE and it should be always latest which is updated?

## REFACTOR
   - [ ] Refactor internal class level variables and methods to start with _ prefix.
   - [ ] The very_verbose is confusing since it only dictates log message (msg) max lenght. It could be e.g. --debug --log-msg-len 150 (also change --log-json)
   - [ ] Move the sfields internal setting to Config and keep the clear sort fields tuple in Base?
   - [ ] Read storage schema directly to config() like the content templates. 
   - [ ] Change is_template in Content to __cmp__?
   - [ ] Refactor --editor? Now it always means yes. The code forces yes to some cases like update solution. This parameter could be changed to no/yes to override internals.

## TESTS
   - [ ] Is tested? import first content that already exist but second is new? Should result OK. Check test_cli_import_snippet_018-> Is the order this?
   - [ ] Add test to import solution without date (check if exist first).
   - [ ] Add unit test for Cause.debug().
   - [ ] Add test to verify --help without server depdencies. This is the PyPI case.
   - [ ] Refactor UT tests.
   - [ ] Add test to verify that there are no string logs when json-logs are used.
   - [ ] Add custom parameter to pytest to enable debug logs in snippy fixture easily. Read https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html?highlight=pytest_addoption
   - [ ] Add tests for 3 scenarios that exit with log in the startup.
   - [ ] Observe if Content.mocked_open and Content.imported_dict has sorting problems because of the hash. This could already sorted because the comparison sorts always the output.
   - [ ] Why test_cli_import_snippet_009 requires import-remove-utc but the 001 does not?
   - [ ] Why delete_storage requires not try/catch block for file remove when the existence is tested? This was with after server/snippy.run refactoring.
   - [ ] Add more tests /api/v1/snippets.
   - [ ] Fix api performance test failure which leaves the server running and hanging.
   - [ ] Test URL encoded REST API queries. The same problem that was with %2C may be with other formats.
   - [ ] Test manually the exception cases for example with file with Python3 and 2.7. Some exceptions may not be in Python2.7.
   - [ ] Fix patching in specific module. E.g snippy.migrate.migrate.os.path.isfile does not patch only specified module. Find 'side_effect' in import snippet.
   - [ ] Fix one failing API test fails all the WF cases? The cleanup does not work?
   - [ ] Why API performance test is so slow? Changed to http.client with 20% perf gain but still slow. Profile code next.
   - [ ] Why tests are failing if falcon is not installed? There is something strange when falcon is uninstalled. After uninstall import still works but variables not there?

## DOCUMENTS
   - [ ] Move test case brief to test case document. This cannot be done untill are cases are in new format because the documentation is lost. When this is done, check the autodock before massive desc move.
   - [ ] Add link to specific OAS (swaggerhub) specficiation from homepage and docs.
   - [ ] Add document note that content type is application/vnd.api+json; charset=UTF-8 inclufing the character set.
   - [ ] It is not possible in OAS 2 to deffine single mandatory parameter from group? For example search must have at least one for GET. For OAS 3 this works?
   - [ ] Document that solution text header date is not updated when the solution is updated. The metadata is updated.
   - [ ] Document that importing content defined with digest will be update operation internally. This allows importing the same content data again with OK cause.
   - [ ] Add to document that using double dash is interpreted as option. To use this in grep: search --sall "--all" --no-ansi | grep -- '--all'
   - [ ] Update documents.

## BUBLING UNDER
   - [ ] Add optional extra fields for logging.warning('test', extra={'foo': 'bar'}) which might be good for json. What fields to add?
   - [ ] There is a pylint bug that it does not see see Python decorators being used with underscore // https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/409
   - [ ] Add setup.py longdescription from readme.rst. // https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] Check security implications from using setup.py (runs code) // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44878600/is-setup-cfg-deprecated
   - [ ] Add very strict validation for REST API? Even a light failure in params generate error?
   - [ ] How to add upgrade procedure? Is this needed? What happens when there is content stored and pip upgrade is made?
   - [ ] How to sign git commits. /1/ https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/) and code n PyPI (?)
   - [ ] How to sign PyPI code? Is this feasible?
   - [ ] Add statistics print that shows the amout of snippets and unique categories.
   - [ ] Fix case described in 'git log 11448a2e90dab3a' and somehow and make test_wf a bit nicer?
   - [ ] How to use BytePackager/packagecore?
   - [ ] Fix the Python2 test database naming to be random temp file in the same folder to allow parallelism.
   - [ ] Why when in Python2 a database test fails, it leaves hanging resources and DB clean does not work? Was this fixed into sqlite3_helper already?
   - [ ] How to better prevent commits to snippy.db than git hooks or git --assume-unchanged?

## FOLLOW EXTERNAL BUGS/ISSUES
