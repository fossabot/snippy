## TODO
   - [ ] Update documents.
   - [ ] Add possibility to limit sall to group. For example --sall exec --sgrp docker.
   - [ ] Fix 'snippy', 'search', '--filter', '.*(\$\s.*)' that produces internal error.
   - [ ] Fix it is not possible to use command line options in keywords? 'snippy', 'search', '--sall', '--all,--quiet', '--no-ansi'
   - [ ] Fix sqlite3 cursor usage. It is not needed always and it is better to release immediately.
   - [ ] Migrate operation can combine same kind of search than in update. Do Config.is_search_context to T for digest,content,KW and run search always for second option.
   - [ ] Refactor importing of text template since it is bit messy at the moment.
   - [ ] Add tests to create solution without proper template. Like with one word.
   - [ ] Document that solution text header date is not updated when the solution is updated. The metadata is updated.
   - [ ] Document that importing content defined with digest will be update operation internally. This allows importing the same content data again with OK cause.
   - [ ] Fix the example string from travis.yml to debug cores. Tee problem is not visible anymore so this requires more investigation.
   - [ ] Add version field to metadata that can hold snippet or solution specific version. This is intended to reflect e.g. Elasticsearch version that is relevant for commands.
   - [ ] The storage.init() in snippy is called multiple times in tests since they run_cli multiple times. This leaks cursor and conn?
   - [ ] Add upgrade procedure. How? Is this needed? What happens when there is content and pip upgrade is made?
   - [ ] Fix upgrading snippy does not update new defaults? Tried with make install to install new version.
   - [Â ] If snippy.release() does not have cause reset, last test failure (NOK) leaves the cause hanging? Why?
   - [ ] Check signing commits (https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/) and code n PyPI (?)
   - [ ] Add statistics print that shows the amout of snippets and unique categories.
   - [ ] Fix case described in 'git log 11448a2e90dab3a' and somehow and make test_wf a bit nicer?
   - [ ] Test BytePackager/packagecore.
   - [ ] Fix the Python2 test database naming to be random temp file in the same folder to allow parallelism.
   - [ ] It seems that in Python2 when database test fails, it leaves hanging resources and DB clean does not work?
   - [ ] Is there better way to prevent commits to snippy.db than git hooks or git --assume-unchanged?
   - [ ] Why mocking sys.exit from arguments causes huge spike in CPU? This basically stalls tests.

## DONE
   - [x] Added tests to use search keywords like --stag or  --sall for delete operations.
   - [x] Changed the Config().reset() to not to create new object when calling and returning from reset().
   - [x] Fixed incorrect OK result when no content was imported at all.
   - [x] Fixed import failure message when same solution data was imported twice.
   - [x] Added support for importing multiple contents from text format.
   - [x] Fixed PyPI long description that was wrapping lines incorrect.
   - [x] Fixed content utc time being null. The time was not read from the template and it may have resulted None time.
   - [x] Fixed the file next() (python2) vs. readline() (python3) for devel.reference.
   - [x] Fixed the last missing empty line(s) from solution import.
   - [x] Added support to specify migrated content with message digest (update specific content).
   - [x] Fixed importing a template so that user does not have to define category in command line.
   - [x] Changed argument parsing for template file. The argparse fails already if no arguments are set to --template.
   - [x] Added import from file which was created from template.
   - [x] Added missing export of content template file.
   - [x] Fixed exporting without specifying the file for operation.
   - [x] Fixed export operation workflow test to properly mock the generated file.
   - [x] Added tox to run tests with multiple Python versions.
   - [x] Fixed invalid message digest during import. Now the digest is checked and updated if needed.
   - [x] Fixed updating solution without --solution option causes the content to be created as snippet.
   - [x] Fixed import content data that already exist. If the data is already in there, it is still OK case.
   - [x] Added same search implementation into solution than snippet.
   - [x] Added easy printing for the Content() so that print(content) works. By default the colors are used.
   - [x] Changed cause management to allow the code flow with empty defaults till the end.
   - [x] Changed log string formatting to avoid doing the formatting with '.format()' when passing the string.
   - [x] Added docker container for the snippy.
   - [x] Fixed importing unknown file that terminates with exception.
   - [x] Fixed importing utc timestamps. The timestamp is not created again when content is imported.
   - [x] Added filename from solution to database.
   - [x] Added import defaults with for snippets and solutions.
   - [x] Fixed solution update that duplicated the header.
   - [x] Fixed incorrect mocking of database that created file::memory:?cache=shared with Python2.
   - [x] Fixed error handling in case mandatory content was not provided or it was empty.
   - [x] Added delete to work with user provided content like in case of update.
   - [x] Fixed delete in case user provided invalid digest like empty (matches all) or to short.
   - [x] Fixed Python 2.7 compatibility.
   - [x] Changed content to be tuple so that it is bit nicer in the yaml and future processing should be easier.
   - [x] Added new storage location with packaging and import defaults.
   - [x] Changed order of links and tags in the terminal output.
   - [x] Fixed the pip packaging and added the uninstall in Makefile.
   - [x] Fixed Apache license layout in generated document. Now the lincese is just pure text.
   - [x] Fixed the make docs and _static folder by creating dummy content and changing the name to source.
   - [x] Changed absolute path of database.sql to relative. This removed the need for mock and relative is better.
   - [x] Fixed hanging database resources that failed sequential test in case of database test failure. 
   - [x] Added timestamp in UTC time for created snippets.
   - [x] Added search with content with -c|--content option.
   - [x] Added basic snippet test suite in common library to avoid writing them to multiple test cases.
   - [x] Changed snippet management. Now Storage() takes care of the snippet conversion between formats.
   - [x] Changed version definition. There is now version.py that is used to read the version.
   - [x] Added support to limit lenght of log strings with -vv option. The --debug option prints full lines.
   - [x] Added search key that allows printing all snippets.
   - [x] Added support for --stag and --sgrp options to search from tags and group columns.
   - [x] Fixed the problem that the digest changed even though no changes were made in editor for the content.
   - [x] Fixed editor update that changed the list of tags to one string in a list.
   - [x] Fixed exit code suppression with the -q option.
   - [x] Added default group 'default' for the content.
   - [x] Added exit status that is by default the only string printed. Options -vv or --debug enable loggin.
   - [x] Fixed inserting same snippet again so that the error is handled nicely.
   - [x] Changed the editor flag internally so that used do not need it when update is made with digest.
   - [x] Changed the CLI commands to behave and look like standard Linux CLI design.
   - [x] Changed small methods that have simple tests in Config() to use ternary operator.
   - [x] Changed print layout and the group to remove space after @ '.. force @docker [2dcbecd10330ac4d]'
   - [x] Changed the resolution to solution since the later is better.
   - [x] Changed the category internally to group to match new command line.
   - [x] Added possibility to update existing snippet.
   - [x] Changed delete to work with the snippet digest instead of database rown number.
   - [x] Added hashes to identify snippets.
   - [x] Changed database tests to use dictionary format.
   - [x] Changed command line arguments to be more suitable for resolve cases as well.
   - [x] Added import functionality from json and yaml files.
   - [x] Added support for categories that allow grouping snippets into larger groups.
   - [x] Added command line option --debug to elevate the debug level and set the default level to error.
   - [x] Added text format export on top of yaml and json.
   - [x] Added multiline command snippets.
   - [x] Added input from editor.
   - [x] Changed tags to behave like links in exported yaml and json files. Keep terminal output of tags as string.
   - [x] Fixed argument testing and printing for tags and find arguments
