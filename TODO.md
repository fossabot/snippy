## WORKING
   - [ ] Change the test with dump_text (or vise versa) to Content.compare_text like with compare_mkdn().
   - [ ] Refactor tests with Content.verified, Content.ordered, Content.compare_dump|Content.****_dump. Cases: import (check after import with YAML) and export (compare in target format.
   - [ ] Refactor tests 1. Content.compare_mkdn, Content.compare_text, Content.compare_yaml, Content.compare_json  # compare exported data
   - [ ] Refactor tests 2. Content.compare_data (replaces Content.verified) # Compare created, updated or imported data in database against YAML formatted reference.
   - [ ] Refactor tests 3. REST API result needs Content.ordered. No changes to this?
   - [ ] Refactor tests 4. Change file mocks to new mocked_file which allows defining the return format for the mock.
   - [ ] Refactor compare to own pytest plugin. (maybe not?)
   - [ ] Refactor tests and fix assert handle.write.mock_calls == references and text_dump in content.py to produce logs what went wrong. Now just AssertError which always requires setting prints. Refactor the current implementation.
   - [ ] Refactor tests so that the Content is used instead of sqlite_helper. Only use Content or Helper (?). The content is a wrapper for content related operations.
   - [ ] Refactor tests and move common items to Helper class in testlib. Do not copy from code because it creates dependency to tested code which cause problems in test case imports.
   - [ ] Fix dump_text and handing of "raw format". The user should be able to use \n "as is" without interpolation. decode immediately in parser? P3: .encode().decode("unicode-escape")) P2:https://stackoverflow.com/a/26867674
   - [ ] Fix new compare that does not see if the last newline is missing? Comment adding newline in text_dump/comare and pytest tests/test_cli_export_reference.py -k test_cli_export_reference_012. This seems to be mismatch in filename?
   - [ ] Fix new compare when the mock file is shorter than references.
   - [ ] Fix new compare to highlight filename mismatch. This incorrect highlights the last line.
   - [ ] Add tests for new compare.
   - [ ] Add possibility to import from other external sources that contain cheat sheet data or snippets in structured format.
   - [ ] Add https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach and refactor Sqlite to more generic. The connect is sqlite but rest SQL is generic?
   - [ ] Add own package from text highlighting. pytest plugin https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html#writing-plugins
   - [ ] Add delete for wheel build directory for automation. If the folder exist this is a problem (at least used to be) see how to fail python release/building/something.

## THINKING
   - [ ] Add code content.
   - [ ] Add Debug() for all classes. Add debug() for snippy that calls all the debugs that Snippy imports.
   - [ ] Add UT tests for class Debug() methods.
   - [ ] Add --help server to list server specific commands and log parameters. Maybe add --help debug/troubleshoot? Debug better because it is shorter?
   - [ ] Add changelog to README.
   - [ ] Add tool configs to pyproject.toml.

## OPTIMIZATIONS
   - [ ] Fix (optimize) migrate and dump. The dump_dict is not needed in case of text and mkdn because those methods do not need the dict format but produce string directly.
   - [ ] Fix (optimize) digest calculation for import. Print the digest string from digest compute and see that it computes digest 4 times for same content.
   - [ ] Fix (optimize) POST API with multiple contents. Now each content in collection is *.run with own resources. The create supports collection so this should work.

## FEATURES
   - [ ] Add support to search phrases like has 'active end'. This should return one result with default set but it returns two since each word is searched separately.
   - [ ] Add support to find dead links.
   - [ ] Add support to edit markup files with cli option.
   - [ ] Add Travis CI for PyPy version v6.0 for Python 3 when it comes https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9542
   - [ ] Add test client to measure performance of the server. The PyPy does not seem to work with api_performance test.
   - [ ] Add compression for the response. Default is pretty print, the --compact-json is applied if request header does not request compression.
   - [ ] Add user management with a new user table that lins to contents table.
   - [ ] Add user authentication. Which one: sessionID, OAuth2, JWS? Maybe OAuth2 (corporate integration) or JWS (embedded, no server?).
   - [ ] Add CORS https://stackoverflow.com/a/45183343
   - [ ] Add /snippy/api/admin/v1/settings for log config. Same base /snippy/api/ for all routes.
   - [ ] Add limit to multilevel sort fields to two fields to avoid complex scenarios.
   - [ ] Add limits to all parameters: column array size, sort array size, etc.
   - [ ] Add logic to name. This can be updated from REST. This should not do anything because of security?
   - [ ] Add logic versions. Change version to content_versions in base? Same all content? Requires long lines for cli.py. How describe versions?
   - [ ] Add support to print only selected fields, like brief and digest for CLI text output. Hard to generalize since layout e.g. contains header with three fields.
   - [ ] Add statistics object which tracks peak and percentile latencies with memory and CPU usage.
   - [ ] Add support for REST API YAML responses.
   - [ ] Add upload command like in setup example from https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] How to add custom Falcon error codes? Now e.g. 500 is HTML string and it is different than normal Snippy server error code.
   - [ ] How to add custom Falcon exception handling through snippy logger?

## SECURITY
   - [ ] Add /snippy/api/auth/v1 for login. Same base /snippy/api/ for all routes.
   - [ ] Remove server name and version from HTTP responses. This would require overriding Gunicorn https://stackoverflow.com/a/21294524.

## FIX
   - [ ] Fix and test adding two same tags, links and categories. At least from text source two tags are duplicated. Verify others.
   - [ ] Fix long description in Markdown format does not support keeping paragraph. The description supports only one paragraph that is wrapped for Markdown. Fix or ok?
   - [ ] Fix (remove) the LANG in Alpine based dockerfile? Is this useless as MUSL does not support locales? https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/144
   - [ ] Fix Gunicorn info logs to debug somehow?
   - [ ] Fix content import from other than text template and API to trimp content same way? for example yaml? The stored content should load as is likely...
   - [ ] Fix '--filter 0' maps to None instead of 0?
   - [ ] Fix does the Parser really return UTF-8 encoded strings always? For example (links/keywords) is not coverted and other use decode(utf-8) which is opposite?
   - [ ] Fix Fields class. It may not have to be inherited like now. The operation ID refresh and logs are problematic now because the Fields logs would refresh OID to be different than with the base class logs. How?
   - [ ] Fix duplicated paths in swagger specs. This seems to work with OAS3.0 (at least it does not complain) But how to specific this in swagger nicely without duplicated code? // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44150758/swagger-2-0-multiple-path-objects-with-different-paths-but-same-request-and-res
   - [ ] Fix (by using OAS3.0?) swagger yaml since it uses 3.0. Componentst and etc should be under defintions // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47293855/swagger-schema-error-should-not-have-additional-properties
   - [ ] Fix it seems that python can do like Config.parameternewparameter which adds new parameter in case of typo. Can this be prevented?
   - [ ] Fix test cases hiding that cls.source was _not_ set in init when the Config.init called storage method that used cls.source. How this can be not noticed?
   - [ ] Fix clarify how insert multiple - one failure behaves. Should have been fail all because of simplicity. Write test and fix.
   - [ ] Fix docs where it was stated that uuid1 contains hostname. It actually contains mac address. This is different per container by default. Two same MACs between containers might not work . //https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings
   - [ ] Fix test case content.verified methot that does not check other content that what gets dumped to text file. This misses checks for example update timestamps and uuid because those are not in text text file in e.g. test_cli_import_reference_011. Should have been dump to yaml instead of text.
   - [ ] Fix print resource it does not print data in debug part because it is empty tuple.
   - [ ] Fix get_resource and next if the collection is empty. This generates StopIteration exception.
   - [ ] Fix tox which seems to test on latest python 3.6 and not e.g. 3.4. Tox -e py34 // http://notes.webutvikling.org/darn-installation-of-python-3-4/
   - [ ] Fix failure to process request like SSL error does not refresh OID. Is there a hook for this?
   - [ ] Fix Parser which assumes always UTF-8. If CLI terminal has something else, this fails.
   - [ ] Fix few failing tests like api perf test in Docker Trusty. Reason unknown. See 'WSGIWarning: Unknown REQUEST_METHOD: 'PATCH''.
   - [ ] Fix 'WSGIWarning: Unknown REQUEST_METHOD: 'PATCH'' It seems Python 2.7 does not support PATCH somewhere? This is coming in docker snippy/python34-trusty when running tests.
   - [ ] Fix schema check in case of error that returns different lenght result depending on Python version? Maybe ok. Maybe not fix. Just to remind.
   - [ ] Fix terminal encodings other than utf-8. Something like this may be needed https://stackoverflow.com/a/33812744.
   - [ ] Fix the Generate() does not need 'json.loads('{"links": {"self": "' + uri + '"}, "data": null}'))' because code is not called with emty collection.
   - [ ] Fix error string that complains about snippet content matching to empty template when the data is empty. See test_api_create_snippet_017.
   - [ ] Fix test reference to match to main(['snippy', 'search', '--sall', '.', '--profile']) and new document stuff
   - [ ] Fix updating cls.server = cls.source.server does not make sense after start. But this was propably fix to some other problem.
   - [ ] Fix insert_content and digest check is probably unnecessary. Remove it after content refactor.
   - [ ] Fix server crash (use e.g. sys.exit(0)) loses e.g. debug config like -vv
   - [ ] Fix all post responses to have link to created resource. Why this is not always included? Only in updates but not in create?
   - [ ] Fix testing error titles. Some contain the hash which now prevent all checks for title. Some titles should be checked.
   - [ ] Fix failing tests print the help. Something was broken. This applies only (rare?) some cases? This comes from UT sqlite cases at least.
   - [ ] Fix help tests since it is not reading new _cli_ tests. What I was thinking?
   - [ ] Fix make test if pytest cover leaves hanging files like .coverage.localhost.localdomain.4727.176219. Add --cover-erase in commmand? // https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/476/coverageexception-cant-add-arcs-to
   - [ ] Fix when server parameters are erronous, error text from argparse is misleading since it complains about the content operations. Custom errors for --server?
   - [ ] Fix OpenAPI specs. The ResponseData and the attributes contain mandatory 'dhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/33812744ata' field. This is not true if resouce field like brief is requirested.
   - [ ] Fix export the original which contains additional whitespace before the exported template in the DATE field. Was this some test?
   - [ ] Fix indention in snippy: error: argument   {create,search,update,delete,export,import}. This indention is actually "must" in --help
   - [ ] Fix the REST API self link is not always present. It is set only in case of resources and if the digest field is not dropped from response.
   - [ ] Fix if the sys._getframe migth not exist in all Python implementations. Rerring to CPython. There is small performance advance using this. Fix?
   - [ ] Fix the example string from travifor templates and s.yml to debug cores. Tee problem is not visible anymore so this requires more investigation.
   - [ ] Why falcon.API fails but the falcon import seems not to produce ImportError when the falcon is not imported?
   - [ ] Why enabling debug logs in pytest fixture for server does not show the logs from mocked REST API call? It only shows fixture imports.
   - [ ] Why 'I/O operation on closed file' is generated as in SCRIBLING.md
   - [ ] Why Logger() UT tests produce out to capsys when the logger Pytest fixture is not used? The logger fixture hides something?
   - [ ] How to use double hyphen with Snippy search queries? Like in: search --sall '--all'
   - [ ] Why changing self._data = data in data setter in line 160 to self.data = data in config base seems to cause core. This can be used to set the Travis gdb parameters.
   - [ ] Should _add_date in Content() be based on updated when DATE already set? The reason would be that this sets the text template DATE and it should be always latest which is updated?

## REFACTOR
   - [ ] Storage update() supports only one resource and this is not in line with others. Change to collection?
   - [ ] Offset based pagination is slow with large data sets (how large?). Measure with test. This was improved in laest sqlite 3.24.0 https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html
   - [ ] Refactor internal class level variables and methods to start with _ prefix.
   - [ ] Read storage schema directly to config() like the content templates.
   - [ ] Refactor --editor? Now it always means yes. The code forces yes to some cases like update solution. This parameter could be changed to no/yes to override internals.

## TESTS
   - [ ] How to get TypeError for --filter in try re.compile? This is not tested.
   - [ ] Refactor test case helper functions to export to yaml file instead of text. Yaml allows checking all params and text missed e.g. timestamps and uuid.
   - [ ] Refactor UT tests for single sqlite DB module. Refactor sqlite tests to single test_ut_sqlitedb.py like with the logger and parser.
   - [ ] Add test to verify that only TLS1.2 and selected ciphers are active. How and is it fast enough?
   - [ ] Add test that verifies that OID is not changing duringn one operation. Run two operations and check two OIDs in dict. Add this also for Field API tests because they inherit the base. If Field is printing log, it will cause the OID to refreshed twice.
   - [ ] Test Collection()/Resource() ne - probably UT tests.
   - [ ] Add tests that tries to sort based on non existent field. Is there already such case - migth be?
   - [ ] Refactor API tests based on update tests.
   - [ ] How to test case where required Python module is missing? Tests can be skipped when module is missing but how to simulate this? Try with Logger and gunicorn.
   - [ ] Is tested? import first content that already exist but second is new? Should result OK. Check test_cli_import_snippet_018-> Is the order this?
   - [ ] Add unit test for Cause.debug().
   - [ ] Add test to verify --help without server depdencies. This is the PyPI case.
   - [ ] Add custom parameter to pytest to enable debug logs in snippy fixture easily. Read https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html?highlight=pytest_addoption
   - [ ] Add tests for 3 scenarios that exit with log in the startup.
   - [ ] Observe if Content.mocked_open and Content.imported_dict has sorting problems because of the hash. This could already sorted because the comparison sorts always the output.
   - [ ] Why test_cli_import_snippet_009 requires import-remove-utc but the 001 does not?
   - [ ] Why delete_storage requires not try/catch block for file remove when the existence is tested? This was with after server/snippy.run refactoring.
   - [ ] Fix api performance test failure which leaves the server running and hanging.
   - [ ] Test URL encoded REST API queries. The same problem that was with %2C may be with other formats.
   - [ ] Test manually the exception cases for example with file with Python3 and 2.7. Some exceptions may not be in Python2.7.
   - [ ] Fix patching in specific module. E.g snippy.migrate.migrate.os.path.isfile does not patch only specified module. Find 'side_effect' in import snippet.
   - [ ] Fix one failing API test fails all the WF cases? The cleanup does not work?
   - [ ] Why API performance test is so slow? Changed to http.client with 20% perf gain but still slow. Profile code next.
   - [ ] Why tests are failing if falcon is not installed? There is something strange when falcon is uninstalled. After uninstall import still works but variables not there?

## DOCUMENTS
   - [ ] Add instructions how to start docker container in README and docs.
   - [ ] Move test case brief to test case document. This cannot be done untill are cases are in new format because the documentation is lost. When this is done, check the autodock before massive desc move.
   - [ ] Add link to specific OAS (swaggerhub) specficiation from homepage and docs.
   - [ ] Add document note that content type is application/vnd.api+json; charset=UTF-8 inclufing the character set.
   - [ ] It is not possible in OAS 2 to deffine single mandatory parameter from group? For example search must have at least one for GET. For OAS 3 this works?
   - [ ] Document that importing content defined with digest will be update operation internally. This allows importing the same content data again with OK cause.
   - [ ] Add to document that using double dash is interpreted as option. To use this in grep: search --sall "--all" --no-ansi | grep -- '--all'
   - [ ] Update documents.

## BUBLING UNDER
   - [ ] Add 'internal server errors' from logger scribling to Sphinx docs. Check that this part is there.
   - [ ] Add optional extra fields for logging.warning('test', extra={'foo': 'bar'}) which might be good for json. What fields to add?
   - [ ] There is a pylint bug that it does not see see Python decorators being used with underscore // https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/409
   - [ ] Add setup.py longdescription from readme.rst. // https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py
   - [ ] Check security implications from using setup.py (runs code) // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44878600/is-setup-cfg-deprecated
   - [ ] Add very strict validation for REST API? Even a light failure in params generate error?
   - [ ] How to add upgrade procedure? Is this needed? What happens when there is content stored and pip upgrade is made?
   - [ ] How to sign git commits. /1/ https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/) and code n PyPI (?)
   - [ ] How to sign PyPI code? Is this feasible?
   - [ ] Add statistics print that shows the amout of snippets and unique categories.
   - [ ] Fix case described in 'git log 11448a2e90dab3a' and somehow and make test_wf a bit nicer?
   - [ ] How to use BytePackager/packagecore?
   - [ ] Fix the Python2 test database naming to be random temp file in the same folder to allow parallelism.
   - [ ] Why when in Python2 a database test fails, it leaves hanging resources and DB clean does not work? Was this fixed into sqlite3_helper already?
   - [ ] How to better prevent commits to snippy.db than git hooks or git --assume-unchanged?
